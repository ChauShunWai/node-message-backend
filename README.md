# node-message-backend 
This is the repo I deployed to heroku:  
[https://klaus-node-message.herokuapp.com/](https://klaus-node-message.herokuapp.com/)  
The React front-end is provided by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller from his Node.js course and is not developed by me  
I just changed the fetch api in the front-end code from RESTful api to Graph api.  
Wrote some graphqlQuery.  
And that's it.  
So, I did not create a new repo for the front-end code.  

You could add, edit, delete your own message and update your own status.  
You could only edit or delete your own message.    
I used AWS S3 to store images and heroku to deploy this node.js application using this repo.

# How to use
Simply go to [https://klaus-node-message.herokuapp.com/](https://klaus-node-message.herokuapp.com/)  
npm start would not work as .env is not uploaded.  
Source code is uploaded just for reference.  
Thanks for staying.
